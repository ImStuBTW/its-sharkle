# It's Sharkle!

## What does this app do?

It's Sharkle!

## No really, what does it do?

It's Sharkle is a small Mac applet that puts the Sharkle desktop toy from the indie game Night in the Woods on your desktop. If your click it, he says Hey~! You can also drag Shakle around and put him wherever you'd like.

## Can it do anything else?

If you go to the boat icon on your taskbar, you can quit the app, invert Shakle's colors, or make him face the other direction.

## Why is this app so large?

I'm a web developer, not a desktop app developer. Shakle's written in a large framework called Electron, which needs to be included in your app distribution.

## How do I build Shakle myself?

`npm install` and `npm start`. Shakle needs Electron 1.8.2.

## Where's the Windows version?

Unfortunately there's some strangeness around Electron and transparent frameless windows on Windows. If you get it working, feel free to let me know.
